# Data formats in Earth Sciences: Geographic coordiate systems

There are two important coordinate systems to describe positions on earth:
1)  Geographic coordinate system
2)  Projected coordinate system

This file contains mostly information about the geographic coordinate system. This system is based on two angular measurements to describe a location on a sphere. The projected coordinate system describes the sphere on 2D. There are several projection methods. Lastly geodetic datums exist. Because earth is far from spherical nor elliptical, different parts of the world are described best by a different datum.  

Coordinates within a Geographical coordinate system can be expressed in different formats:
-   decimal degrees
-   degrees, minutes, seconds
-   degrees, decimal, minutes

### Characteristics
-   Latitude lines run east-west from 0-90 degrees on both the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere. The northern hemisphere is denoted by the letter N and the southern hemisphere is denoted by the letter S. Instead of a letter, a minus sign in front of the degrees can be written for the southern hemisphere.
-   Longitude lines run from pole to pole and run from 0 to 180 to the west and east. East is denoted positive, west is denoted negative, or respectively by the letters E and W.

### Coordinates systems in earth sciences
Coordinates are important in earth sciences because most research in earth sciences includes spatial data:
-   it is often important to know exactly where a sample  is taken from
-   In geological research it is important to note strike and dip, using coordinates 
-   geographical information systems run on spatial data
