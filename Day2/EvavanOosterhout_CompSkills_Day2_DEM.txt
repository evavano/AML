# Data formats in Earth Sciences: DEM

DEM stands for Digital Elevation Model, and is a raster dataset representing terrain elevations. The DEM is organized in a matrix of pixels and represents the surface of the earth. 
DEM's come in different resolutions. The main resolution groups are the 10 and 30 meter grid DEM. DEM's are often constructed using radar satellites. 
DEM's can be used in a GIS, for satellite navigation, in enegineering or in geomorphology and hydrology. 

### Histroy
It is hard to know exactly when DEM's were used the first time. The USGS started using DEM's in 1992.
