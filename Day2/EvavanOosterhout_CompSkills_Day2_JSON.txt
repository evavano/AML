# Data formats in Earth Sciences: JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is used to store attribute-value pairs and array data types. It is 
easy to read and write for humans. One of the uses of JSON is that output of sensors, like thermometers, is given in JSON format. 


The characteristics of JSON files are:
- easy to read for humans
- key valley pairs
- separated by commas
- objects hold by {}
- arrays hold by []
- data elements are enclosed with double quotes ""

### History
JSON was developed in the beginning of the 2000s, because real-time server-to-broswer communications was needed.
